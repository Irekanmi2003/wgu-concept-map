### **1. Amputation**  
#### **Recognizing Cues**  
1. Visible partial or complete limb loss.  
2. Patient reports phantom limb pain (burning, tingling in absent limb).  
3. Swelling, redness, or warmth at the surgical site.  
4. Limited range of motion in adjacent joints.  
5. Emotional distress (tearfulness, withdrawal, or anger).  

#### **Disease Process / Risk Factors**  
- **Pathophysiology**: Ischemia, trauma, or infection leads to tissue necrosis, necessitating surgical removal. Post-op, nerve endings may misfire (phantom pain).  
- **Risk Factors**: Diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, trauma, osteomyelitis.  

#### **Analyzing Cues**  
**Supporting**:  
- History of diabetes/PVD correlates with etiology.  
- Phantom pain confirms neurological adaptation.  
- Swelling indicates normal post-op inflammation.  

**Concerning**:  
- Purulent drainage → infection risk.  
- Refusal to look at stump → body image disturbance.  
- Immobility → risk of DVT or contractures.  

#### **Prioritizing Hypotheses**  
1. **Risk for infection** (stump compromised integrity).  
2. **Impaired physical mobility** (limb loss, pain).  
3. **Disturbed body image** (grief over loss).  

#### **Take Actions**  
1. Assess stump every 4 hours for signs of infection (erythema, odor).  
2. Teach stump wrapping techniques (figure-eight bandaging) to shape limb for prosthesis.  
3. Collaborate with physical therapy for gait training and prosthetic fitting.  
4. Provide counseling and peer support groups for emotional coping.  

#### **Generated Solutions**  
- **Stump care education** → prevents infection → promotes timely healing.
